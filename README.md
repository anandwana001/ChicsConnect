# ChicsConnect
Chics Connect App will help girls find other girls and be friends with them wherever they are.
So when you register yourself on the app after a strict process of scrutiny, the app will find your location and show you other girls in the Chics Connect community in the same location whom you can connect with. If you are travelling to some other location you can choose the location and find girls in that location to hangout with, connect, collaborate and never ever feel lonely. You can also create events and girls in that location would be able to see the events and will be able to come for it.

Chics Connect is a trusted community of women where girls can discover and make new friends and network like never before. It aims at connecting women seamlessly into a network worldwide so that they are never alone no matter wherever they are.
In conferences and official meetings we hardly get to build that bond and connect with each other and is always a one sided thing. Thus we keep these meetups across the globe to let women sit on one table and pour their heart out and connect to each other like never before.
